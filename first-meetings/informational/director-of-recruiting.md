# Director of Recruiting

Hi there,   
  
My name is Ian Tien and I'm co-founder and CEO of Mattermost. I'm looking forward to meeting you to discuss the [Director of Recruiting](https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/c63ad9a4-be73-4b51-8710-3741566a038f) role at our company. At Mattermost we have a concept of "hiring 90s", which means everyone--the candidate, the recruiting team and our founders--believes there's a 90% or better chance of a new hire being successful in their role, in our culture for at least the next 2-3 years, and ideally much longer. Ideally, we want you to do the best work of your career here. 

In this letter, I hope to share some information about our company and our culture, and to focus our brief time together understanding the potential for this role and our company to align to your professional aspirations:   
  
Mattermost is the second [open source, remote-first company](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/handbook.html#company) to join the [Top 100 YC Companies](https://medium.com/@it33/mattermost-joins-gitlab-in-yc-top-100-as-new-open-source-remote-company-cdcb0706e7eb) list after GitLab. This role is pivotal to both accelerating our business--which raised a [$50M Series B](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/iantien_mattermost-opensource-slack-ugcPost-6547125036682215424--c-v) just months after a [$20M Series A](https://www.techrepublic.com/article/how-open-source-mattermost-is-sneaking-up-on-slacks-messaging-empire/) this year--and deepening our commitment to a [work-from-home environment](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/working-at-mattermost.html#work-anywhere), which as of October 2019 has a staff NPS score of 91%. Moreover, we have over 1000 people from our [open source community](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/community-overview.html) contributing to our products and we're now translated into 16 languages based on community efforts. 

Our [Mission and Leadership Principles](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/handbook.html#about-mattermost) define our intention and how we behave. I've tried to lay out below the context for each of our LPs to the Director of Recruiting role. 

In addition to any questions you have for me on the materials shared here, here are six questions on culture I hope to discuss with you in our meeting: 

**Customer Obsession:** As a growth-stage open source company we're temped to move in different directions. In one direction there are the [ever-increasing requests](https://mattermost.uservoice.com/forums/306457-general/status/1588363) from the open source community, in another there is the drive for monetization and revenue. Among all the possible optimizations we make a conscious choice to focus on the success of our customers above all else. Our intention is to hyper-scale an organization that is "obsessed" with customers being successful and everything we do--from recruiting, to infrastructure, to spending company money--is ideally seen through the lens of helping our customers succeed. We believe the success of customers leads to the success of our business.  
  
_1\) If you were on a Zoom call with our entire company how would you frame the recruiting function in the context of a customer-obsessed culture?_ 

**High Impact:** When choosing between high impact activities and low impact activities we choose to invest in areas of greater impact. In a fast-growing company, this often means using [learn, master, teach cycles](https://docs.mattermost.com/process/training.html#learn-master-teach) to stretch ourselves into critical, high impact areas where we don't have strong expertise or deep experience. 

_2\) What do you see as the_ [_high impact responsibilities for this role_](https://jobs.lever.co/mattermost/c63ad9a4-be73-4b51-8710-3741566a038f) _in our open source, remote-first culture where a\) you feel competent and prepared, and b\) you believe you'll need to enter a learn, master, teach cycle?_ 

**Ownership**: When you're hyperscaling a remote-first company with a work-from-home organization of around 80 people across 20 countries/regions clarity, process and trust become must-haves. There's not the ability to bump into someone in a hallway to unblock an issue. Ownership means we own outcomes and lead projects to completion across departments and timezones with clear communication, intention and context. 

_3\) How would you approach developing a culture of ownership among the recruiting team in an open source, work-from-home culture across 20 countries/regions?_ 

**Self-awareness:** As an open source culture, we naturally believe in transparency and iteration. To iterate and improve we must be clear-minded about our strengths and opportunities as individuals and as organizations. Someone who is open about failure, reflection, adaptation and eventual success is more valuable to our team than someone who is continually "spinning" a story of near perfection in everything they do. 

_4\) In the context of self-awareness and iteration, if you were to ask your last three managers to rate your achievements on a scale of 1 to 10, how would they rate your work and why?_ 

**Earn Trust:** Trust means opening yourself up to vulnerability and failure based on the positive expectations of someone else. A work-from-home culture is innately high trust, since there's no supervision on how people are spending their time. Our customers and our colleagues have to trust us to deliver on our commitments, and we need to earn and keep that trust. When failures do inevitably happen, we need to act in way that increases the trust of our customers and colleagues in our decisions. 

_5\) Please share a story of when you lost someone's trust on something important that was your fault and how you earned back the trust._ 

**Insist on High Standards:** Our people need to be excellent, especially our leaders. High standards means  we are detail-oriented and continually raise the bar on our own expectations. 

_6\) What does it mean to you to be excellent in a remote-first culture?_ 

Thank you again for interviewing with us, and for your time meeting me. I look forward to our conversation.
