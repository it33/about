# Leadership Principles Interview

Hi there, 

My name is Ian and I'm CEO of Mattermost, Inc. and a co-creator of the Mattermost open source project. Thank you for investing the time in getting to know our company and exploring the opportunity to build this company together.

I'm interested to know one thing: _Is Mattermost a place where you can do the best work of your career?_ 

This means understanding: 

a\) who you are  
b\) what skills and accomplishments you're interested in developing    
c\) what is the potential to exceed your own expectations in working here

Our recruiting process is focused on answering these questions, and in our upcoming meeting I hope we can learn more about each other and the possibilities ahead. 

You can learn more about our company and leadership principles--**Customer Obsession, Ownership, High Impact, High Standards, Self-Awareness, Earning Trust**--at: [https://mattermost.com/about-us/](https://mattermost.com/about-us/)

You can learn more about me and my approach to leading our teams [in my README file](../). 

Because our time is limited, I would ask your help complete a brief survey the day before our meeting so we can make the most of our time together, [here is a link to the questions](https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSfGFUN7baIFot6me_oDWTSICA_QhRFM9dBRiqBTw38uRY6XDQ/viewform).

In the survey, there's a section to ask questions, and I'm excited to answer whatever you'd like to talk about, 

Looking forward to speaking to you soon, 

Ian
