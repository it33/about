# Review Meeting Primer

In meetings where I'm a reviewer I'm going to ask for some basic information.   
  
**1. Goals** - Please have a written statement of your goal or goals for your project.   
****  
It's important that it's written so we're aligned on what we're trying to achieve. If it's a measurable goal, like reliability, please have a measure stated somewhere in the summary on a target or range, e.g. "Uptime of at least 99.5%".   
  
**2. Priorities** - If you have more than one goal, please list goals in priority order. 

If there's ambiguity, I may sometime ask "If you had a dollar, how would you allocated it across your goals? Is it more like $0.70, $0.20 and $0.10 or more like $0.50, $0.30, and $0.20 or some other variation?" 

**3. Definitions** - Please use unambiguous terms over terms with multiple possible meanings. 

Example: "Renewal Rate" could have multiple meanings. "QTD Renewal Rate \($USD Bookings\)" is unambiguous.  

**4. Facts and Assumptions** - I may ask to clarify facts and assumptions.   
  
For facts I may ask for specifics, like "How many customers were affected?", "When did the customer first raise the issue?", "What is the job title of the champion we are talking to?". 

For assumptions, I'll ask why we hold certain assumptions and how our thinking might change if we held different assumptions. 

**5. Three options** - If a conclusion isn't clear to me, I may ask for 3 options with pros & cons, and a recommendation.

Reviewing three possible options and the one recommended helps me understand key trade-offs and how they are being considered.
