# Review Meeting Primer

In meetings where I'm a reviewer I'm going to ask for some basic information.   
  
**1. Goals** - Please have a written statement of your goal or goals for your project.   
****  
It's important that it's written so we're aligned on what we're trying to achieve.   
  
**2. Priorities** - If you have more than one goal, please be prepared to explain the priorities of your goals.   
****  
A common question I will ask is "If you had a dollar, how would you allocated it across your goals? Is it more like $0.70, $0.20 and $0.10 or more like $0.50, $0.30, and $0.20 or some other variation?"   
  
I ask this question to understand how we are prioritizing what you are working on.

**3. Definitions** - If you use terms whose meanings cannot be looked up in a dictionary, and for which multiple definitions may exist, I may ask you to define those terms in writing so that we are clear 

Many meetings lose productivity because people have different definitions of the same word. Please anticipate this and write things down when the word is not in the dictionary and not unambiguous. 

Unique Page Views is clear because it is a standard term with only one widely understood definition. Renewal Rate is an extremely ambiguous term and should not be used without a clear qualifier like Renewal Rate \(Bookings\) or Renewal Rate \(Logos\). 

**4. Facts and Assumptions** - I may ask you about what parts of your proposal or analysis are based on facts and which are based on assumptions.   
  
For facts I tend to ask for specifics, like "How many customers were affected?", "When did the customer first raise the issue?", "What is the job title of the champion we are talking to?". 

In most real world issues, there's going to be gaps in facts available, and we'll make assumptions. I'll be curious why an analysis makes certain assumptions, and how our thinking might change if we assumed another case. 

**5. Three options** - When we are trying to make an important decision under uncertainty, I may ask the presenter to share three options, with pros and cons to each, and from there we can decide on an option. 

In general, talking through three options helps concisely frame the most important trade-offs and lets us understand which approach is most aligned to our goals.
