# Frequently Asked Questions

### I've started a company, we're looking for product-market fit, what should I focus on? 

To get to product-market fit as quickly as you can I would suggest focusing on three things:  

1. Talking to users
2. Building product
3. Exercise

Exercise is a proxy for being healthy, including good diet and sleep. 

### Should I apply to Y Combinator? 

If you are a first-time founder pursuing a multi-billion dollar market opportunity and ready to raise funding in about 3-4 months \(with or without YC\), I would recommend applying to potentially accelerate your business, positively influence your valuation, and join a community of like-minded company builders. 

### What might increase my chances to get into Y Combinator? 

While it's been a while since I applied to YC, here are my thoughts: 

1. Read all of [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). They are like the curriculum for the program
2. Watch a session of [YC Startup School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcefcZRL2oaA_uBNeo5UOWg) on YouTube \(e.g. Startup School 2019, Startup School 2018, the latest complete one might be best\) 
3. Apply early

### **How do I raise funding?** 

In my mind the first step is to convince yourself of the inevitable success of your company, then share that conviction with investors in a structured way. Aaron Harris from YC has a good [YouTube video on raising funding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzz4AEIddzY). 

### Should I pursue an MBA? 

I think MBA programs can be really different so I can only really comment on the Stanford MBA program, also known as "GSB" for "Graduate School of Business". 

GSB was amazing for me. It's a highly luxurious time where you funnel energy into your own learning and growth. You hang out, have fun, have silly dreams and try to find your way in life, with a cohort of soon-to-be-friends who are all doing the same thing. 

I had professors like Condoleezza Rice, Eric Schmidt, and Joel Peterson, and worked as a teaching assistant for Andy Grove and Myron Scholes. Many classmates have gone on to be outstanding investors, founders and executives around the world. For me there's a tremendous warmth when I get to catch up with this very special group of friends, with whom I shared a very special time together.
