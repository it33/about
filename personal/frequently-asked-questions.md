# Frequently Asked Questions

### I've started a company, we're looking for product-market fit, what should I focus on? 

To get to product-market fit as quickly as you can I would suggest focusing on three things:  

1. Talking to users
2. Building product
3. Exercise

Exercise is a proxy for being healthy, including good diet and sleep. 

### Should I apply to Y Combinator? 

If you are a first-time founder pursuing a multi-billion dollar market opportunity and ready to raise funding in about 3-4 months \(with or without YC\), I would recommend applying to potentially accelerate your business, positively influence your valuation, and join a community of like-minded company builders. Acceptance rates are around 1.5% at the time of this writing, so you should not count on getting into YC. 

### What might increase my chances to get into Y Combinator? 

While it's been a while since I applied to YC, here are my thoughts: 

1. Read all of [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). They are like the curriculum for the program
2. Watch a session of [YC Startup School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcefcZRL2oaA_uBNeo5UOWg) on YouTube \(e.g. Startup School 2019, Startup School 2018, the latest complete one might be best\) 
3. Apply early

### **How do I raise funding?** 

In my mind the first step is to convince yourself of the inevitable success of your company, then share that conviction with investors in a structured way. Aaron Harris from YC has a good [YouTube video on raising funding](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jzz4AEIddzY). 

### Should I pursue an MBA? 

If you're asking me about getting an MBA my assumption is you're interested in a career in technology, company building and/or general management. If this is the case, I'd highly recommend the MBA program I went through, which was the Graduate School of Business \(or "GSB"\) at Stanford. I can't really comment on other MBA programs. 

GSB was amazing for me. It's a luxurious time where you funnel energy into your own learning and growth. You hang out, have silly dreams and try to find your way in life, with a cohort of soon-to-be-friends who are all doing the same thing. I had professors like Condoleezza Rice, Eric Schmidt, and Joel Peterson, and worked as a teaching assistant for Andy Grove and Myron Scholes. I keep in touch with hundreds of classmates annually, many of whom have become outstanding investors, founders, leaders and executives. For me, it was an elevating, transformational experience personally and professionally.
