# Packing List \(1%\)

While in a remote-first lifestyle I predominantly work from home, I also spend a lot of time getting things done from coffee shops, airports, hotel rooms, borrowed offices and even other people's homes.   
  
I'm starting a project here to document the priorities and methods I'll use to stay happy and efficient for whatever adventure unfolds.

## Packing List VPMOM

Joyful, distraction-free day-to-day operations with well-prepared, efficient, continuously improvement materials and tools available when needed 

### Priorities

- Joy distraction-free operations - Enable focus on what matters most   
- High Impact then Efficient - Ensure critical needs are met, then optimize for weight   
- Earn Trust and Iterate - Invite feedback and be open to continuous improvement 

### Methods

- Laptop bag packing list   
- Roller bag packing list   
- Redundant backups - Have backup   
- Easy-to-refill - Make it easy to replenish consumables   
- Invite feedback - Invite feedback via GitLab issues \(easy SSO\) 

### Obstacles

- Security/privacy risk -  Avoid disclosing information compromising security or privacy 

### Measures
