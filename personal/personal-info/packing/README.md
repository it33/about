# Packing List \(1%\)

While in a remote-first lifestyle I predominantly work from home, I also spend a lot of time getting things done from coffee shops, airports, hotel rooms, borrowed offices and even other people's homes.   
  
I'm starting a project here to document the priorities and methods I'll use to stay happy and efficient for whatever adventure unfolds. I've also drafted a [Packing List VPMOM](packing-list-vpmom.md) to keep me mindful of priorities and measures.
