# README VPMOM

Vision

* Increase trust, alignment, impact and efficiency in spending time with professional colleagues and personal friends through openly documenting and consciously iterating on how I operate 

Priorities

* **Aligned Communities:** Being open about how I operate lets people self-select in and out of joining our company and/or spending time with me.
* **Conscious Competence:** Writing down how I work lets me assess my operations and iterate who I am for the better, in addition to hearing external feedback to what are otherwise internal processes. 
* **Earn Trust and Iterate:** Increase trust of new colleagues in the CEO by being open, and iterating on feedback to continually improve.
* **High Impact then Efficient:** Help prospective colleagues prepare for CEO interviews and informationals so they can get maximize the information they want out of the conversations 

Methods 

* **Architecture** - Share how I think and behave so you can anticipate our conversations 
* **Mindsets** - Share frameworks to build common understandings and solve problems faster  
* **First meeting pre-reading** - Share information relevant to interviews and informationals so you can make the most of the time we have

Obstacles

* Information can fall out-of-date over time
* Privacy and security issues may arise out of high levels of disclosure 
* Sharing how I think can create opportunities for others to manipulate me
* Risk of deep mis-impressions of me based on what's written vs. getting to know me

Measures  

* Increased alignment of new executives due to open sharing of how I work and my expectations 
* Amount of time saved by people understanding how I operate ahead of interacting with me
