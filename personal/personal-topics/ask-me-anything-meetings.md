# "Get your thoughts" meetings

Hi there,   
  
I'm glad we were introduced by a mutual friend and I am looking forward to meeting you to share thoughts and attempt to be helpful on any topic you choose.   
  
You can find my bio on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/) and a list of [questions and answers from past calls](../frequently-asked-questions.md) I've done, in case they can be helpful. 

The best time for me is typically a 25m phone call **8:30am Palo Alto time on Saturdays.** 

It's typically before the rest of my family is awake and it is the same time as the [daily sync I have with my leadership team on weekdays](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/handbook/operations/operations-30/mlt-cadence-80#mlt-sync) so I'm naturally ready to go at that time.

That said, I'm also very happy to find time via my EA if other times are more convenient.   
  
I've posted some frequently asked questions below in case they are helpful.   
  
I'm looking forward to speaking to you soon,   
  
Ian
