# "Get your thoughts" meetings

If we've been introduced by a mutual friend for a "get your thoughts" discussion I'm generally happy to speak on a 15-25m phone call **8:30am Palo Alto time on Saturdays.** 

It's typically before the rest of my family is awake and it is the same time as the [daily sync I have with my leadership team on weekdays](https://mattermost.gitbook.io/handbook/operations/operations-30/mlt-cadence-80#mlt-sync) so I'm naturally ready to go at that time.

To make the most of the time I've tried to answer some frequently asked questions that come up in these meetings: 

## Frequently Asked Questions

### I've started a company, we're looking for product-market fit, what should I focus on? 

To get to product-market fit as quickly as you can I would suggest focusing on three things:  

1. Talking to users
2. Building product
3. Exercise

Exercise is a proxy for being healthy, including good diet and sleep. 

### Should I apply to Y Combinator? 

If you are a first-time founder pursuing a multi-billion dollar market opportunity and ready to raise funding in about 3-4 months \(with or without YC\), I would recommend applying to potentially accelerate your business, positively influence your valuation, and join a community of like-minded company builders. 

### What might increase my chances to get into Y Combinator? 

While it's been a while since I applied to YC, here are my thoughts: 

1. Read all of [Paul Graham's essays](http://www.paulgraham.com/articles.html). They are like the curriculum for the program
2. Watch a session of [YC Startup School](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCcefcZRL2oaA_uBNeo5UOWg) on YouTube \(e.g. Startup School 2019, Startup School 2018, the latest complete one might be best\) 
3. Apply early
