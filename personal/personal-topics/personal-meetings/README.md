# Catching up with friends

## Catchup Meetings

For 1-1 catch-up meetings Saturday mornings are best for me, either on the phone or in-person. Most often catch-ups are with classmates from family friends, school, YC or past companies where we worked together. 

### Saturday morning phone catch-ups 

2pm Palo Alto time on Saturdays are the best time to catch up personally on a phone call. It parallels my weekday leadership meeting call so I am naturally ready to talk then.

## **Family Playdates**

I love to hang out with other founders and execs on weekends for family playdates when we have kids around the same age. Usually our kids take 10-15 minutes of nervous "I don't want to meet new people" until they are having fun. In the meantime, I get to spend time with folks who have similar world views, aspirations and challenges. 

The challenge with working all the time--when work is meaningful and energizing--is not having enough time with family to build memories and have fun. The challenge with playdates chosen by our kids is often that there's not much to talk about with the parents of our kids friends if we aren't in similar industries or roles at work.   
  
Here's some of the places we love to have family playdates:
