# README

This is a README page for learning more about me before meeting professionally or socially. 

This page is under deployment and the percentage indicators \(e.g. 0%, 1%, 50%, 99%\) show where I am in building out the sections.

## General Information 

You can find me publicly on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/iantien?lang=en). My background and biography are on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/iantien/). I don't use Facebook much anymore. I tend to keep WhatsApp limited to people I intend to talk to.

## Caveats

1. **Being this open isn't for everyone** - Some people have suggested README files for people who work for me. I know this would be highly uncomfortable for people who value privacy. I DO NOT encourage people to publish README files. It's just my personal preference.  
2. **This is the past, not the future** - Anticipate iteration in everything here.  
3. **No sales people, please** - I try to be open on how I operate professionally while at the same time keeping my name and my company name off this page to avoid sales people getting creepy--if you're a sales person who's some how found this page on me, please realize how creepy you'll come across using the info here.
