# README

This is a README page for learning more about me before meeting professionally or socially. 

This page is under deployment and the percentage indicators \(e.g. 0%, 1%, 50%, 99%\) show where I am in building out the sections.

## Caveats

1. **Being this open isn't for everyone** - Some people have suggested README files for people who work for me. I know this would be highly uncomfortable for people who value privacy. I DO NOT encourage people to publish README files. It's just what I like to do. 
2. **This is the past, not the future** - Anticipate iteration in everything here.  
3. **No sales people, please** - I try to be open on how I operate professionally while at the same time keeping my name and my company name off this page to avoid sales people getting creepy--if you're a sales person who's some how found this page on me, please realize how creepy you'll come across using the info here.
