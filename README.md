### Leadership Style 

What's it like to work with me?

I've tried to summarize my leadership style in a purpose statement: 

>My purpose is to lead teams by unlocking the potential in individuals and organizations to deliver meaningful outcomes we are all proud of. 

I'm sharing it hear so that you'll have context on how I try to lead ahead of our meeting or working together. To unpack this a bit, here are three components of my purpose in priority order: 

- Impact: The "meaningful outcomes we are all proud of" part means I value notable team wins over big personal wins or small team wins. I'm excited about big wins in teams.  

- Genius: As part of "unlocking the potential in individuals and organizations", I believe every single person has Zones of Genius within them. Everyone has world class talents and abilities that unlock with the right orientation and encouragement. I'm excited about bringing those out in people. The second part of Genius is about organizations. The power of an organization is operating as the sum of our strengths. My approach to leadership is these two things put together--finding the Genius among individuals, and iterating on the organization to have it operate as the sum of its collective Genius. 

- Relationships: Part of "lead teams" and "outcomes we are all proud of" speaks to our human relationships. Trust in relationships--by being open and vulnerable--is the foundation to the organizations I want to belong to. It's only through trust and strong relationships that we can have self-awareness, critique and iteration needed to grow into our better selves over and over. 

These are my personal leadership values. If these resonate with you, maybe there's an opportunity to work together in future. Happy to discuss them if we're talking.

## Caveats

1. **Being this open isn't for everyone** - Some people have suggested public README files for people who work for me. I know this could be highly uncomfortable for people who value privacy. I DO NOT encourage people to publicly publish README files. It's just my personal preference and choice. No one should be pressured to do this. 
2. **This is the past, not the future** - Anticipate iteration in everything here.  
3. **No sales people, please** - I try to be open on how I operate professionally while at the same time keeping my name and my company name off this page to avoid sales people getting creepy--if you're a sales person who's some how found this page on me, please realize how creepy you'll come across using the info here.
